# Pokemon-Analysis-and-ML-model

1>  Pulled Pokemon Data Using API taken from Rapid API's.<br>
2>  Pulled multiple datasets, Conversted them into pandas dataframe form json format and cleaned them for further Analysis.<br>
3>  Analyzed the data and gained multiple insights.<br>
4>  Key Insights include-<br>
      i. Most common Pokemon types.<br>
      ii. Top 10 fast and charged moves<br>
      iii. Top 5 types of Attack, Defence and Stamina Pokemons.<br>
      iv. Pokemon Rarity Distribution.<br>
5>  Created a Classification Model using Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm.<br>
6>  Loaded the Dataset Concatinated.<br>
7>  Trained the model to predict Pokemon Rarity Based on its attack, defence and stamina powers levels.<br>
8>  Model sucessfully created and working with 88% accuracy level.<br>
9>  Showed the accuracy level of model using a graph.<br>
