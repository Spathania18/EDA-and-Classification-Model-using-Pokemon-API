# Pokemon-Analysis-and-ML-model

1>  Pulled Pokemon Data Using API taken from Rapid API's.<br>
2>  Pulled multiple datasets, Conversted them into pandas dataframe form json format and cleaned them for further Analysis.
3>  Analyzed the data and gained multiple insights.
4>  Key Insights include- 
      i. Most common Pokemon types.
      ii. Top 10 fast and charged moves
      iii. Top 5 types of Attack, Defence and Stamina Pokemons.
      iv. Pokemon Rarity Distribution.
5>  Created a Classification Model using Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm.
6>  Loaded the Dataset Concatinated.
7>  Trained the model to predict Pokemon Rarity Based on its attack, defence and stamina powers levels.
8>  Model sucessfully created and working with 88% accuracy level.
9>  Showed the accuracy level of model using a graph.
